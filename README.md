# 🌾 Agricultural Equipment Sharing Platform

## 📌 Overview

The **Agricultural Equipment Sharing Platform** is a full-stack web application built using **React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL**.

It provides a digital marketplace where:

* 🚜 Equipment Owners can list their agricultural machinery
* 🌱 Farmers can search and book equipment
* 🛡️ The platform ensures fair pricing, transparency, and secure transactions

The system is designed to solve the problem of limited farm mechanization access, especially for small and marginal farmers.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

In India, nearly 85–90% of farmers do not own mechanized equipment due to high capital costs.

Current challenges include:

* High equipment purchase costs (₹8–50 lakhs)
* Informal and exploitative rental markets
* Lack of availability visibility
* Double booking conflicts
* No dispute protection system
* Equipment underutilization (60–70% idle time)

This platform provides a centralized, transparent, and scalable solution.
